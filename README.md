# Scientific Paper Rater  

### What is it?
This is a simple web application that allows users to rate scientific papers. The application is built using the 
node framework and the express framework, and uses html/css for the frontend.

### Why ? 
Recommended by the Prof. as an internal requirement for PICT. So we decided to build it.
